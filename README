What is it: A simple nodejs script you can use to manage a number of redis pre-shards. (Here's hoping for great things from cluster)

How to use it: 
1. Modify masterTemplate.conf to your liking
2. Set up redisMaster.conf with your instances, follow the json as an example
3. Set up your pub/priv keys so you can ssh, scp to your instances without entering a pass
4. Modify the path's and then copy redisInitScript.sh, startRedis.sh, stopRedis.sh to your user directory on each instance
5. Use nodejs to invoke redisManager.js ie, node redisManager.js with the commands: redisManager.js -c [createConfigs|startAll|stopAll]

Make sure you run createConfigs first. Also requires js-opts (https://bitbucket.org/mazzarelli/js-opts/wiki/Home)
