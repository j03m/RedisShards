What is it: A set of nodejs scripts you can use to manage a number of redis pre-shards. (Here's hoping for great things from cluster)

There are two scripts you want to be aware of: RedisManager.js and redisRing.js

RedisManager.js is a tool that will spin up and configure redis instances on different machines providing you have SSH to those machines.

How to use it: 
1. Modify masterTemplate.conf to your liking
2. Set up redisMaster.conf with your instances, follow the json as an example
3. Set up your pub/priv keys so you can ssh, scp to your instances without entering a pass
4. Modify the path's and then copy redisInitScript.sh, startRedis.sh, stopRedis.sh to your user directory on each instance
5. Make sure your ssh user can execute those scripts on the remote instances
6. Use nodejs to invoke redisManager.js ie, node redisManager.js with the commands: redisManager.js -c [createConfigs|startAll|stopAll|execute]

Make sure you run createConfigs first. Also requires js-opts (https://bitbucket.org/mazzarelli/js-opts/wiki/Home)

redisRing is essentially a wrapper around the node_redis client (https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) that uses
node hash ring (https://github.com/bnoguchi/node-hash-ring) to direct your queries to different shards. The code always
uses your key as the basis for which instance to hit - so there are some obvious gotchas with using the m* operations. Be warned.
